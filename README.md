# StudioFramework

StudioFramework library for .NET - implementations of common patterns and architecture for quickly building 'studio-like' desktop applications.

Currently targeting WPF, but the intention is to keep a presentation-agnostic structure which can be adapted to other frontends such as Avalonia.
